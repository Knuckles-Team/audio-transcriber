# Heartbeat — Periodic Self-Check

You are running a scheduled heartbeat. Perform these checks and report results concisely.

## Checks

1. **Tool Availability** — Call `list_tools` or equivalent to verify your MCP tools are reachable. Report any connection failures.
2. **Memory Review** — Read `MEMORY.md` and check for any pending follow-up tasks or action items. List any that are overdue.
3. **Cron Log** — Read `CRON_LOG.md` and check for recent errors (❌). Summarize any failures from the last 24 hours.
4. **Peer Agents** — Read `AGENTS.md` and note if any registered peers need attention.
5. **Domain-Specific Checks**:
   - **Processing Queue**: Check for pending or stalled audio files in the watch directories.
   - **Service Health**: Verify that the underlying transcription service/model is loaded and reachable.
6. **Self-Diagnostics** — Report your current model, available tool count, and any anomalies.
